        <p>Hi! My name is Gordon, I am currently a student in the Front End Masters Web Development Bootcamp. I made this site to show a bit of what I have learned so far in HTML and CSS. It's a work in progress, and will be updated as I learn more!</p>
        <p>I am also a professional musician with advanced degrees in clarinet performance. I work as a teacher, performer, and arts administrator, which means I have experience working under immense pressure, and meeting deadlines in a fast-paced work environment. Below, you can read more about me, my work experience, and my interests.</p>
